# user-tweet_database

This is a project 3 classmates and I worked on for our database management course as part of our Masters program. 

We were tasked with designing a database to store information about twitter users and their tweets.

We were also required to use both an SQL database and a NoSQL database.

We decided to use PostgreSQL to store the information about the users and MongoDB to store the information about the tweets.

We then designed a search interface to query the database, and also implemented caching.

Please read our final report for an in depth explanation of our project.
